We are learning git commands today.
We learned about
`git branch` it is used to make copies of our code that we can edit distinctly from
other parts of the project
example usage:
git branch <my_new_branch>
git checkout <my_new_branch>
git branch -a  # to check that we are now on the new branch!

Another command that we learned about was `git add`, it is used to add a file to our
project such that we can share it with our friends.

example usage:
git add my_new_file.txt
git status  # to list the new files or changes that have been added to your project.
git diff  # will show you which specific lines of code you have changed.

We resolved the merge conflict.

Another command that corresponds to `git add` is `git rm`
example usage:
git add my_file.txt
cp my_file.txt my_file2.txt
git add my_file2.txt
git status  # this will show that 2 files have been added to the repository
git commit -am 'my 2 files for an example of deleting.'
git rm my_file2.txt
git status  # this will inform you that the file was deleted
git commit -am 'delete the duplicate file.'
